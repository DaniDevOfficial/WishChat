## About

WishChat is a simple Chat app where the user is able to send and recive messages form Single People or even groups. In adition the user can send a image attached to the Messages. Do finish later

## Example




### local installation:

1. clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/David21092/WishChat/tree/dev
```

2. cd into cloned repo

```
cd wishchat
```
```
cd .\Client\wishchat\
```
3. install dependencies

```
npm install
```

```
npm install react-router-dom
```

```
npm install firebase 
```

```
npm install @firebase/app
```

```
npm install react-icons/fa
```

4. Create Firebase DB

Due to the fact that you cant use my firebase realtime DB because i would have to give out my Tokens, you need to create your own one and just simply connect it with the app. This File should be called "firebaseConfig.jsx", its located in the src folder and should look something like this: 

<br/>import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
<br/>import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth'
<br/>
<br/>const firebaseConfig = {
<br/>  apiKey: "YOUR_TEMP_API_KEY",
<br/>  authDomain: "YOUR_TEMP_AUTH_DOMAIN",
<br/>  databaseURL: "YOUR_TEMP_DATABASE_URL",
<br/>  projectId: "YOUR_TEMP_PROJECT_ID",
<br/>  storageBucket: "YOUR_TEMP_STORAGE_BUCKET",
<br/>  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_TEMP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
<br/>  appId: "YOUR_TEMP_APP_ID"
<br/>};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export const auth = getAuth(app);


5. run the app

```
npm run start
```

<br />
